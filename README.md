# Building A Game in JavaScript

## Directions

For this project, you are going to build a simple game with JavaScript. First, make sure you've [watched this video of Mary Rose Cook building a game from scratch](https://youtu.be/hbKN-9o5_Z0). Check out [her annotated version of Space Invaders](http://annotated-code.maryrosecook.com/space-invaders/docs/space-invaders.html).

Then pick one of the following games:

* [Pixel War](http://www.lessmilk.com/game/pixel-war-1/)
* [Run](http://www.lessmilk.com/game/run/)
* [The Square](http://www.lessmilk.com/game/the-square/)

Your job is to implement this game in JavaScript. You can use external libraries, but nothing that would be considered a game framework. Your game must use JavaScript objects for organization.
